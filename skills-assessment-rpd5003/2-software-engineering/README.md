Software Engineering Fundamentals
=================================

We write lots of software at 47Lining, both for internal use in the
re-usable data platform services that we use across multiple
customers, as well as for specific customers as needed on a
case-by-case basis.

This exercise allows you to demonstrate your capabilities and approach
to a basic software engineering problem.

Instructions
------------

1. Review the [User Story](specifications/user-story.md), including context,
   assumptions, development constraints, and acceptance criteria
2. Develop your solution
3. Create a ```deliverable``` directory and place your solution there
4. Please include tests for your solution within your deliverable
5. Please include a ```README.md``` for your solution within your deliverable.
   Include instructions to build and run your solution in the README.  We should
   be able to get it up and running easily by using your instructions.
