Welcome to the 47Lining Skills Assessment!
==========================================

At 47Lining, now part of Hitachi Vantara, we're building a differentiated
team with capabilities to create customer-specific industrial process
optimization solutions, driven by repeatable data lake, data services, and
data ops platform.

This skills assessment is designed to provide you with a flavor of the types
of work that our teams deliver, and to provide us with some insight into
the way that you take problems apart and create solutions.

The assessment includes four exercises:

1. [Problem Decomposition and Work Specification](1-decomposition/README.md)
2. [Software Engineering Fundamentals](2-software-engineering/README.md)
3. [SQL Fundamentals](3-sql/README.md)

This repo contains a top-level directory for each of these exercise, which includes a README that provides detailed instructions for that exercise.
