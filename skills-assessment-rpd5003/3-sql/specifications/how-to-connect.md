How to Connect to tickit
========================

1. You will need a SQL JDBC client.  You can use whatever client you'd
   like.  Many of our developers use [SQL
   Workbench/J](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/), which is free and easy
   to [download](https://www.sql-workbench.eu/downloads.html).

2. To [Configure your JDBC
   Connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html)
   you may need to
   [download](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-jdbc-connection.html#download-jdbc-driver)
   and
   [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-using-workbench.html)
   the Redshift JDBC driver.  We have successfully used the [JDBC
   4.2-compatible
   driver](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/jdbc/1.2.16.1027/RedshiftJDBC42-1.2.16.1027.jar)
   with the latest SQL Workbench/J.

3. You will need the username and password supplied to you for this
   purpose by your recruiting specialist.

   - endpoint: ```tickit.47lining.com```
